<div class="h4  mt-3">A TooU Ticket was sent to me. How do I redeem it?</div>
A TooU is a ticket that can be redeemed for merchant products up to a specific value on the ticket. You can use it at the merchant when you order your items. To use your TooU, log on to your account and select the ticket you would like to use and the merchant where you are redeeming the ticket. Tell the cashier/server that you would like to redeem a TooU and the product you would like. Product availability will be based on the merchant availability. Provide the merchant the redemption code and enjoy the treat you your friends have bought you.

    What is TooU's policy for Tipping and Tax?
</div>    
Tips are generally included in the value of your ticket. The merchant is paid the full value of the ticket and there is no change received once the ticket is redeemed. For example if you redeem a $10 TooU beer ticket for a $8 beer, the merchant is paid the full $10 to cover taxes and tip. Merchants may set different policies. Please be sure to tip appropriately depending on the venue's policy. If you have any questions please feel free to contact our support team.

TooU tickets are delivered via text message initially and then are applied to your TooU account based on your phone number. Please log on to TooU.gifts and check your account using your Phone Number. No luck? The sender may have used the wrong contact details when purchasing the ticket.
